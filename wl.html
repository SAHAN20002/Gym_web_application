                <p>Weight lifting, also known as resistance training or strength training, is a form of exercise that focuses
                     on improving muscle strength and endurance by lifting weights. It involves the use of free weights like
                      dumbbells and barbells, as well as machines that provide resistance. Weight lifting is one of the most 
                      effective ways to build muscle mass, enhance physical performance, and improve overall fitness levels. <br> <br>
                      At the core of weight lifting is the principle of progressive overload, which refers to gradually increasing 
                      the weight or resistance you lift over time to stimulate muscle growth and strength. Exercises can target different
                       muscle groups, such as the chest, back, legs, shoulders, and arms. Some common weight lifting exercises include 
                       bench presses, squats, deadlifts, shoulder presses, and bicep curls. <br><br>
                       Weight lifting provides numerous health benefits beyond building muscle. It helps improve bone density, which is 
                       crucial for preventing osteoporosis, especially in older adults. It also promotes fat loss by increasing metabolism,
                        as more muscle mass means your body burns more calories even at rest. Additionally, weight lifting enhances 
                        cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure and improving cholesterol levels.Moreover, weight lifting 
                        contributes to better posture, flexibility, and balance, reducing the risk of injury in daily activities. 
                        It also has mental health benefits, such as reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, while boosting confidence and self-esteem.
